âœ¨ Design Decisions and Challenges
Component Reusability: Separated concerns into individual components (like IncidentCard, IncidentList) to maximize reusability and scalability.

Theme Management: A ThemeProvider and ThemeToggle were implemented to allow dynamic theme switching.

Mock Data: Used mock data during early development (mock/mockData.js) to simulate real-world scenarios without backend dependency.

Routing: Simple and clean client-side routing with react-router-dom, handling 404s with a NotFound.jsx page.

Animation: Smooth UI transitions using Framer Motion to enhance user experience without overloading performance.

Challenges: TailwindCSS v4 introduced a few breaking changes from v3, requiring careful migration, especially around utility classes and plugins.
